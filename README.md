# ipfs-check

> Check if you can find your content on IPFS

A debugging tool for checking the retrievability of data by IPFS peers

## Install

`go install github.com/ipfs/ipfs-check@latest` will build and install the server binary in your global Go binary directory (e.g. `~/go/bin`)

### Docker

Automated Docker container releases are available from the [Github container registry](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-check/pkgs/container/ipfs-check):

- Releases
  - `latest` always points at the latest stable release
  - `vN.N.N` point at a specific [release tag](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-check/releases)
- Unreleased developer builds
  - `main-latest` always points at the `HEAD` of the `main` branch
  - `main-YYYY-DD-MM-GITSHA` points at a specific commit from the `main` branch
- ⚠️ Experimental, unstable builds
  - `staging-latest` always points at the `HEAD` of the `staging` branch
  - `staging-YYYY-DD-MM-GITSHA` points at a specific commit from the `staging` branch
  - This tag is used by developers for internal testing, not intended for end users

When using Docker, make sure to pass necessary config via `-e`:
```console
$ docker pull ghcr.io/ipfs/ipfs-check:main-latest
$ docker run --rm -it --net=host -e IPFS_CHECK_ACCELERATED_DHT=true ghcr.io/ipfs/ipfs-check:main-latest
```

Learn available variables via `./ipfs-check --help`

## Build

### Backend

`go build` will build the `./ipfs-check` binary in your local directory

### Frontend

There are web assets in `web` that interact with the Go HTTP server that can be deployed however you deploy web assets.
Maybe just deploy it on IPFS and reference it with DNSLink.

For anything other than local testing you're going to want to have a proxy to give you HTTPS support on the Go server.

At a minimum, the following files should be available from your web-server on prod: `web/index.html`, `web/tachyons.min.css`.


## Running locally

### Terminal 1

```console
$ go build
$ ./ipfs-check
Starting ipfs-check
...
2024/08/29 20:42:34 Please wait, initializing accelerated-dht client.. (mapping Amino DHT may takes 5 or more minutes)
2024/08/29 20:42:34 Accelerated DHT client ready
2024/08/29 20:46:59 Backend ready and listening on [::]:3333
2024/08/29 20:46:59 Test fronted at http://localhost:3333/web/?backendURL=http://localhost:3333
2024/08/29 20:46:59 Ready to start serving.
```

As a convenience, a test frontend is provided at <http://localhost:3333/web/?backendURL=http://localhost:3333>.

### Terminal 2

If you don't want to use test HTTP server from ipfs-check itself, feel free to
use any other tool to serve the contents of the /web folder (you can open the
html file directly in your browser).

```
npx -y serve -l 3000 web
# Then open http://localhost:3000?backendURL=http://localhost:3333
```

## Running a check

To run a check, make an http call with the `cid` and `multiaddr` query parameters:

```bash
$ curl "localhost:3333/check?cid=bafybeicklkqcnlvtiscr2hzkubjwnwjinvskffn4xorqeduft3wq7vm5u4&multiaddr=/p2p/12D3KooWRBy97UB99e3J6hiPesre1MZeuNQvfan4gBziswrRJsNK"
```

Note that the `multiaddr` can be:

- A `multiaddr` with just a Peer ID, i.e. `/p2p/PeerID`. In this case, the server will attempt to resolve this Peer ID with the DHT and connect to any of resolved addresses.
- A `multiaddr` with an address port and transport, and Peer ID, e.g. `/ip4/140.238.164.150/udp/4001/quic-v1/p2p/12D3KooWRTUNZVyVf7KBBNZ6MRR5SYGGjKzS6xyiU5zBeY9wxomo/p2p-circuit/p2p/12D3KooWRBy97UB99e3J6hiPesre1MZeuNQvfan4gBziswrRJsNK`. In this case, the Bitswap check will only happen using the passed multiaddr.

### Check results

The server performs several checks depending on whether you also pass a **multiaddr** or just a **cid**.

#### Results when only a `cid` is passed

The results of the check are expressed by the `cidCheckOutput` type:

```go
type cidCheckOutput *[]providerOutput

type providerOutput struct {
	ID                       string
	ConnectionError          string
	Addrs                    []string
	ConnectionMaddrs         []string
	DataAvailableOverBitswap BitswapCheckOutput
	DataAvailableOverHTTP    HTTPCheckOutput
	Source                   string
}
```

The `providerOutput` type contains the following fields:

- `ID`: The peer ID of the provider.
- `ConnectionError`: An error message if the connection to the provider failed.
- `Addrs`: The multiaddrs of the provider from the DHT.
- `ConnectionMaddrs`: The multiaddrs that were used to connect to the provider.
- `DataAvailableOverBitswap`: The result of the Bitswap check.
- `DataAvailableOverHTTP`: The result of the HTTP check.
- `Source`: The source of the provider (either "IPNI" or "Amino DHT").

#### Results when a `multiaddr` and a `cid` are passed

The results of the check are expressed by the `peerCheckOutput` type:

```go
type peerCheckOutput struct {
	ConnectionError              string
	PeerFoundInDHT              map[string]int
	ProviderRecordFromPeerInDHT  bool
	ProviderRecordFromPeerInIPNI bool
	ConnectionMaddrs             []string
	DataAvailableOverBitswap     BitswapCheckOutput
	DataAvailableOverHTTP        HTTPCheckOutput
}

type BitswapCheckOutput struct {
	Enabled   bool
	Duration  time.Duration
	Found     bool
	Responded bool
	Error     string
}

type HTTPCheckOutput struct {
	Enabled   bool
	Duration  time.Duration
	Endpoints []multiaddr.Multiaddr
	Connected bool
	Requested bool
	Found     bool
	Error     string
}
```

The check performs several validations:

1. Is the CID advertised in the DHT by the Passed PeerID (or later IPNI)?
   - `ProviderRecordFromPeerInDHT`: Whether the peer has a provider record in the DHT
   - `ProviderRecordFromPeerInIPNI`: Whether the peer has a provider record in IPNI

2. Are the peer's addresses discoverable?
   - `PeerFoundInDHT`: Map of discovered addresses and their frequency in the DHT

3. Is the peer contactable with the address the user gave us?
   - `ConnectionError`: Empty if connection successful, otherwise contains the error
   - `ConnectionMaddrs`: The multiaddrs used to connect (includes both relay and direct addresses if NAT traversal occurred)

4. Is the data available over Bitswap?
   - `DataAvailableOverBitswap`: Contains:
     - `Enabled`: Whether Bitswap check was performed
     - `Duration`: How long the check took
     - `Found`: Whether the block was found
     - `Responded`: Whether the peer responded
     - `Error`: Any error that occurred

5. Is the data available over HTTP?
   - `DataAvailableOverHTTP`: Contains:
     - `Enabled`: Whether HTTP check was performed
     - `Duration`: How long the check took
     - `Endpoints`: List of HTTP multiaddrs
     - `Connected`: Whether connection was successful
     - `Requested`: Whether the request was sent
     - `Found`: Whether the block was found
     - `Error`: Any error that occurred

## Metrics

The ipfs-check server is instrumented and exposes two Prometheus metrics endpoints:

- `/metrics` exposes [go-libp2p metrics](https://blog.libp2p.io/2023-08-15-metrics-in-go-libp2p/) and http metrics for the check endpoint.

### Securing the metrics endpoints

To add HTTP basic auth to the two metrics endpoints, you can use the `--metrics-auth-username` and `--metrics-auth-password` flags:

```
./ipfs-check --metrics-auth-username=user --metrics-auth-password=pass
```

Alternatively, you can use the `IPFS_CHECK_METRICS_AUTH_USER` and `IPFS_CHECK_METRICS_AUTH_PASS` env vars.
